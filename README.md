# mesosphere-advanced-cluster-course
A repository containing the exercises I followed while building a Mesospher cluster running Apache Mesos, Marathon, Mesos DNS, Chronos, Docker and Ansible from https://open.mesosphere.com/advanced-course/

Note I have ommited two large images:
* outyet.tar.gz (Docker image)
* package.box (VBox image)

You will need to follow the tutorial to create them.
